# Automatic Control

This repository collects **MATLAB scripts** for key concepts in **Automatic Control Systems Ι**.  
It includes open/closed loop analysis, pole-zero calculations, step responses, frequency-domain plots, and controller design (P, PI, PID).  

Developed as academic practice to gain familiarity with the **Control System Toolbox**.

### Basic Control & MATLAB
- Transfer functions: `tf`, `series`, `*`
- Symbolic variable: `s = tf('s')`
- Poles/zeros: `pole`, `zero`, `roots`
- ZPK representation: `zpkdata`
- Closed-loop: `feedback`
- Responses: `step`, `lsim` (general input-output simulation, not only unit step response)
- Frequency domain: `bode`, `nyquist`
- Root locus: `rlocus`

## Requirements
- MATLAB R2020b or later  
- Control System Toolbox
